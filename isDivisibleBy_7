# check if a number is divisible by 7

# we need to follow the below steaps:
# 1: identify the the last digit
# 2: double the last digit like 2*12
# 3: remove the last digit from the number like 616 % 10 = 61
# 4:subtract the double last digit from the remainder like 61 - 12 = 49 
# 5: check if 49 is divisible by 7 then yes
# 6 if the numbers greater then follow the above rule for the next steaps

        number -= 2 * last_digit # subtract twice the last digit from the remaining number
        
        # Check if the final number is divisible by 7
