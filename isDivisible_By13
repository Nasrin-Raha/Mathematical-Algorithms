# is divisible by 13:
# follow rules
# 1 : double the last last_digit
# 2: subtract doubled value from the rest of the number
# 3: repeat the process until you have the small number
# 4: check if the result if divisible by 13


# simple way
#def isDivisible_By_13(number):
  #  return number % 13 == 0
    
    
# more complex way

def isDivisible_By_13(number):
    # Use absolute value to ensure correct results for negative numbers
    number = abs(number)
