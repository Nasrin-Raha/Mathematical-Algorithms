#Mathmatical Algorithm:

#Check if a large number is divisible by 6 or not

# we use two conditions: The number must be divisible by 2.
# The number must be divisible by 3.
#Divisibility by 2: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).
#Divisibility by 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.


def divisibleBySix(number):
    divisible_by_2 = number % 2 == 0 # check if divisible by 2 
    
    sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(number)) # check if divisible by 3
    divisible_by_3 = sum_of_digits % 3 == 0
    
    return divisible_by_2 and divisible_by_3

    

number = 132
if divisibleBySix(number):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
